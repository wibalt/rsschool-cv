## Future Front-End Developer
---
## _Summary_
I am 29 years old, a little girl's mom (last 2 years I am on maternity leave). I have a master degree of Mathematical Sciences which includes mathematical applications, data analysis and optimization, statistical calculations and programming also.
I deside to learn something new in IT and I participated to "Women Go Tech" program which led me to programming. I have been looking for role that would suit for me most and I found Front-End development (I am interested in web development because I have always wondered what a websites like, its ergonomics and user experience. I always wanted to change a certain block on the website that is out of place). 

 
Although, I have no experience at real projects yet, but I have already finished some online courses, a few courses are in progress. 
I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Front-End Developer.
